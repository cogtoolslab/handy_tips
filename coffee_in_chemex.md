# How to make coffee in a Chemex

1. Fill kettle, set to heat to 95 celcius.
2. Open a chemex filter, place in chemex so that 3 layers of filter are over the spout.
3. Briefly wet chemex filter with hot so that a little water gets through to bottom of chemex.
4. Add splash of hot water to all mugs.
5. Drain chemex water into sink or mug for extra warming.
6. Add 17g of coarsely ground coffee beans to chemex for every large mug of coffee you want to make (adjust if stronger/ bigger/ smaller/ weaker coffee desired). (17g is roughly 3 tablespoons)
7. "Bloom" the grounds by wetting them with hot water- give them a little jiggle to make sure all are wet. Wait 30s.
8. Pour hot water over grounds in continuous, roughly-circular motion. The goal is to let the water get soaked in by the beans, not shoot down the side or create channels for water to slip through. 300g of water per mug is a good target, but eyeballing it without scales is fine. Under is better than over as you can always water it down after.
9. Wait for water to pass through (~2 mins).
10. Remove coffee filter and grounds, empty pre-heated mugs, pour coffee.
11. Clean up any mess you've made, rinse chemex with hot water.
