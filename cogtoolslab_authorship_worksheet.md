# cogtoolslab authorship worksheet
Author: Judy Fan; Last updated: Jan 13 2022

This worksheet is intended to guide individual thinking about authorship order for specific papers, especially for frontline researchers working in larger teams. It is a working, living document and is not meant to be the final word on how to think about this complex issue. However, I do believe it can serve a useful purpose in helping to have healthy and systematic conversations about authorship order (under the unfortunate constraint that co-authorship is still, somewhat anachronistically, generally encoded using list-like data structures).

## General principles (unordered)
1. Originating the idea
2. Carrying out the idea (i.e., consistent contributions sustained over time; counterfactually consequential to implementation)
3. Interpreting & communicating the work (i.e., willingness to bring all of the threads together; write the paper / polish the figures / give the talk)
4. Accountability for the work (i.e., sense of responsibility for overcoming obstacles; effective action taken with that sense of responsibility)
5. Professional consequences (i.e., how much will what kind of authorship impact career advancement?)
