0. First, check out [Kayvon's Clear Talk Tips (CTT)](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~kayvonf/misc/cleartalktips.pdf). This document is meant to provide some extra tips that may be especially useful when giving talks to a Cognitive Science (i.e., Psychology, AI, Neuroscience) audience, that aren't explicitly addressed in Kayvon's CTT.
